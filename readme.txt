TestGithub
==========

TestGithub is a repository for showing the bare minimums of github and how to maneuver, function, etc.


insertion at the bottom means i can type
esc to exit the typing mode (and insertion disappeears)
the :x to save or :q to exit without saving

nano seems easier than vim with commands
